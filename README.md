# Gradient Boosting Reinforcement Learning (GBRL)
GBRL is a Python-based Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) library, similar to popular packages such as [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/), but specifically designed and optimized for reinforcement learning (RL). GBRL is implemented in C++/CUDA aimed to seamlessly integrate within popular RL libraries.

## Overview

GBRL adapts the power of Gradient Boosting Trees to the unique challenges of RL environments, including non-stationarity and the absence of predefined targets. The following diagram illustrates how GBRL uses gradient boosting trees in RL:

GBRL features a shared tree-based structure for policy and value functions, significantly reducing memory and computational overhead, enabling it to tackle complex, high-dimensional RL problems.

## Key Features: 
- GBT Tailored for RL: GBRL adapts the power of Gradient Boosting Trees to the unique challenges of RL environments, including non-stationarity and the absence of predefined targets.
- Optimized Actor-Critic Architecture: GBRL features a shared tree-based structure for policy and value functions. This significantly reduces memory and computational overhead, enabling it to tackle complex, high-dimensional RL problems.
- Hardware Acceleration: GBRL leverages CUDA for hardware-accelerated computation, ensuring efficiency and speed.
- Seamless Integration: GBRL is designed for easy integration with popular RL libraries. We implemented GBT-based actor-critic algorithm implementations (A2C, PPO, and AWR) in stable_baselines3 [GBRL_SB3](https://github.com/NVlabs/gbrl_sb3). 

## Performance

The following results, obtained using the `GBRL_SB3` repository, demonstrate the performance of PPO with GBRL compared to neural-networks across various scenarios and environments:
