Gradient Boosting Trees Module
==============================

The Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) module is a core component of the GBRL library, optimized for reinforcement learning tasks.
It includes the base class from which specific implementations of various Actor-Critic algorithms inherit from.
The GBT module can be used as a standalone class for supervised learning.
