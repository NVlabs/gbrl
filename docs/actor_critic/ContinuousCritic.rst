ContinuousCritic Class
======================

This class implements a GBT-based Continuous Critic learner for reinforcement learning.
The ContinuousCritic class is designed  to output the parameters of a differentiable Critic function (e.g., linear, quadratic). 
Usage examples: GBT-based SAC/DDPG/TD3 implementations.
