Welcome to GBRL's documentation!
================================
GBRL is a Python-based Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT) library, similar to popular packages such as `XGBoost <https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__ , `CatBoost <https://catboost.ai/>`__ , but specifically designed and optimized for reinforcement learning (RL). GBRL is implemented in C++/CUDA aimed to seamlessly integrate within popular RL libraries.
